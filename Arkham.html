    Written by Corey May, Ryan Galletta and Dooma Wendschuh, the game's main storyline is set five years before that of 2009's Batman: Arkham Asylum and follows a younger, less-refined Batman.<br><br> A bounty is placed on him by crime lord Black
    Mask, drawing eight of the world's greatest assassins to Gotham City on Christmas Eve. The villains, including the Joker and Anarky, take advantage of the chaos to launch nefarious schemes, while Gotham City police try to apprehend Batman.</p>

  <p>Arkham Origins is an open world action-adventure game incorporating stealth game tactics. Batman can use his cape to glide around Gotham City and the grapnel gun's retracting rope to attach to hard-to-reach ledges and extend his flight.[3] Some
    gadgets from previous Arkham games are present at the start of Arkham Origins, while others become available during play. Returning gadgets include the Cryptographic Sequencer, used to hack security consoles; the Batclaw, used for hooking onto
    surfaces; the Batarang, a throwing weapon;<br><br>[4] the Remote Batarang, its remote-controlled counterpart; Explosive Gel, used to destroy weak surfaces and knock down enemies;[5] Smoke Pellets, used for stealthy exits and entrances;[6] the
    Disruptor, which can remotely disable guns and explosive mines,[6] and the Grapnel Accelerator, an earlier version of the Grapnel Boost.<br><br>[7] New equipment in Batman's arsenal include the Remote Claw; this allows Batman to target two
    objects and pull them together, allowing him to throw enemies into each other or hit them with objects[8] (tethering two walled points creates a tightrope for Batman to cross);[9] Shock Gloves, which allow Batman to block electric attacks,
    disable some enemies and stun shielded ones, and short-circuit objects,[10] and the Concussion Detonator, capable of stunning large enemy groups.[11]</p>

      </div>
    </center>
  <p>The events in Arkham Origins take place about five years before Batman: Arkham Asylum, in midwinter Gotham City.[44][74] Batman, an experienced crime-fighter in the second year of his career, is not yet the veteran superhero of Arkham Asylum and
    Arkham City.[24][74] He is a mysterious force; even the police do not know whether he is a vigilante, a myth or a supernatural being.[75] Batman has fought ordinary criminals and gangsters, and is accustomed to being stronger and faster than his
    opponents.<br><br>[40] However, on a snowy Christmas Eve he is confronted with more-dangerous foes: eight professional assassins hoping to collect a $50-million bounty placed on Batman's head by Black Mask.[74][76] Villains (including the Joker)
    take advantage of the assassins' arrival to launch their own schemes, and Black Mask's henchmen instigate a rise in crime and gang activity in the city.[8][44]
